# Light Object Language

**Successor of "Object Zero" repo (private) for my "Light Object Language".**

This library is misnamed. It is actually an attempt (number 3 or so) at creating an interpreter. My previous repos are private (and for good reason). I have previously implemented a Robinhood hash table, but it was messy and I didn't understand why it worked. This code is much better.

I am building out my standard library that I will use for the interpreter. I am also interested in building a transpiler.

## Visibility

This repository is public not because I want my half-built code to be visible, but rather so I get unlimited Github Action minutes (not that I am close to using the limit anyways).

## Prototyping

Prototyping will be done in Python. I am faster at writing Python and its error handling is faster to hack together.
